# Paths
Don't pay attention to the story; it's the effort that counts. I mean, how did I survive before I realised Bootstrap existed? Still, it's not bad, even though it's nothing to brag about.
## About
What is this exactly? Well I'm wondering that myself. Probably another one of my attempts at writing a story.
## How to Use
It's on [Heroku](https://paths-story.herokuapp.com/) (because I made it on Node.js). Watchout, none of the buttons work, so WYSIWYG.
